# DLB-Autocomplete
### TO RUN ###

Run by using the main file, ac_test. If a history.txt file is not found in the directory, a new empty file will be created.
Searched terms will take priority over unsearched terms, which the history.txt will account for.
To use, type in one character at a time and press the "enter" key.

### OTHER KEY FUNCTIONS: ###
* 1 through 5 - The number of the choice you have made from the suggestions, if valid, is chosen and saved in your history.
* $ - The currently typed out searched term is selected. If it does not exist in the dictionary, then it will be added.
* ! - Exit the program at any time.

### SPECIAL FEATURES: ###
* The program's dictionary is stored in a De la Brandias trie (DLB Trie)
* Saved searches take priority over unsearched terms

### YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED: ###
* The program's saved searches are ordered based on how many times it has been searched already.
